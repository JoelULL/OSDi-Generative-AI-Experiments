# OSDi-Generative-AI-Experiments

This repository contains the full transcripts of the conversations conducted with generative artificial intelligence (AI) models during the experimental phase of the research project:
“Ontology-Guided Generative AI: A Prompt Engineering Study in Health Economic Evaluation Models.”

The conversations documented here correspond to a series of structured prompts sent to different generative AI models , ChatGPT o-4.1 and Perplexity Deep Research as part of a factorial experimental design. These experiments aimed to assess the ability of the models to populate an ontology by generating structured instances relevant to health technology assessment (HTA), using varying levels of contextual information.

## Folder structure

* **[CU1/](CU1/)** – Use case 1: Basic prompts with minimal context (PICO + task only)

* **[CU2/](CU2/)** – Use case 2: Prompts with conceptual model context

* **[CU3/](CU3/)** – Use case 3: Full-context prompts based on a complete HTA report

All content was generated between 16/04/2025 and 18/05/2025.

The research associated with this repository was carried out as part of a final-year project in computer engineering, exploring how generative AI models can be guided by ontological structures to generate structured knowledge for use in health economic evaluation models.
